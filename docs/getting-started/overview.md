# Overview

Mirix is a memory system you can plug into any agent stack. It captures and structures information over time, then makes it retrievable through a unified API.

## What Mirix Provides

- Multi-agent memory pipeline that writes to six memory components (core, episodic, semantic, procedural, resource, knowledge)
- Pluggable client API that works with hosted or self-hosted backends
- Search and retrieval across memory types with BM25 and embedding-based queries
- Local-first data storage and configurable retention policies

## Product Direction

Starting with version 0.1.6 on the [`main` branch](https://github.com/Mirix-AI/MIRIX/tree/main), Mirix is no longer a desktop personal assistant. The desktop agent has been deprecated and lives on the [`desktop-agent` branch](https://github.com/Mirix-AI/MIRIX/tree/desktop-agent).

## Where to Go Next

- **Quickstart:** [Get to a working client in minutes](quickstart.md).
- **Memory Write:** [Configure LLMs, embeddings, and retention](../memory-write/configuration.md).
- **Memory Search:** [Query memories with the search API](../memory-search/search.md).
