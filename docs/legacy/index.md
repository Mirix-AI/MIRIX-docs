# Legacy Documentation

This section contains the original documentation for the deprecated desktop assistant and its supporting backend. It is preserved for reference if you are working from the `desktop-agent` branch.

## What Moved Here

- Desktop app setup and UI walkthroughs
- Backend usage notes for the old assistant stack
- Advanced topics like backups, performance, and security

## Recommended Path

If you are using the current memory system release (0.1.6+ on `main`), start with `getting-started/overview.md` instead.
