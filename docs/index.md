## Use Cases

!!! example "Digital Activity Tracking"
    
    MIRIX automatically tracks your digital activities, from reading documents to browsing websites, creating a searchable timeline of your digital life.

!!! example "Context-Aware Assistance"
    
    Ask questions about your recent activities: "What was I reading about machine learning yesterday?" or "Where did I save that document about PostgreSQL?"

!!! example "Knowledge Management"
    
    Automatically extract and organize information from documents, websites, and applications you interact with.

!!! example "Workflow Documentation"
    
    Learn and remember your common workflows, making it easier to repeat complex tasks.

## System Requirements

- **Python 3.11** or later
- **Node.js 14** or later (for the desktop app)
- **PostgreSQL 17** (recommended) or SQLite
- **GEMINI API key** (We use GEMINI because it can load images from google cloud and the API is free to end users.)
